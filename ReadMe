NiziPOS™ B20 Simulator

A web-based simulator for the NiziPOS™ B20 device, designed to interact with CH341 serial devices via the Web Serial API. This tool enables users to connect to a device, send commands, upload and display images, and monitor serial communication logs in real-time. Key features include:

Serial Communication: Connect to CH341 devices with configurable baud rates (9600 to 115200).
Command Interface: Send predefined commands (e.g., Display Logo, Text Display, QR Payload, Sleep, Wake) with customizable parameters.
Image Upload & Loop: Upload multiple JPEG, PNG, or BMP images (up to 6) with drag-and-drop support, preview, and looping display functionality.
Real-Time Monitoring: View serial logs with timestamps, color-coded statuses (info, success, error, warning), and optional timeout visibility.
Device Management: Automatic detection of CH341 devices with a modal for selecting from multiple devices.
Responsive UI: Clean, modern interface with a grid layout, styled using CSS for an intuitive user experience.

Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Web Serial API for device communication
FileReader API for image processing

Usage:
Open in a Web Serial API-compatible browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge).
Connect to a CH341 device via the interface.
Use the command inputs or upload images to interact with the device.
Monitor real-time serial communication in the logs.

Note: Ensure the browser supports the Web Serial API and the CH341 device is properly connected.
